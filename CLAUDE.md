# CLAUDE.md - Agent Instructions

- ALWAYS run linting after changes.
- ALWAYS check CLAUDE.md and linked files after a set of changes to make sure
  all instructions have been followed.

## Commands

- Website build: `pnpm build`
- Website dev: `pnpm dev`
- Website test: `pnpm test` (single test: `cd [app/package] && pnpm test [testname]`)
- Extension build: `pnpm run extension/build`
- Extension dev: `pnpm run extension/dev`
- Lint: `pnpm lint` (fix automatically: `pnpm lint:fix`)
- Format config files: `pnpm lint:config` (fix: `pnpm lint:config:fix`)

## Code Layout

- Shared utility code should go in `packages/shared/src/`, and be imported elsewhere via the `@repo/shared` module.
- This repository uses `turbo` to manage cross-package building and dependencies.

## Code Style

- Don't use semicolons
- Follow the workspace biome rules via @repo/biome-config .
- For filetypes that aren't supported by biome, use prettier instead
- Use default exports for single exports
