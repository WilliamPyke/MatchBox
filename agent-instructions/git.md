### Git commits

- Don't commit changes to conventions at the same time as other changes.
- Create a commit for each logical cohesive step in an implementation.
- Use concise prose commit messages explaining why we made a change in addition to what happened. Wrap at 80 chars.
- Run linting, type-checking, and tests before every commit---MAKE SURE EACH ONE RUNS.
